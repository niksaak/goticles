*The gothicless gravitating particle simulation*

#### HIC SVNT PRTICLI

This is the place where I make the particles fly and gravitate to each other.
For this I am using the Go language, fourth order Runge-Kutta integrator and,
of course, my own head and hands. [This][gafferongames] set of tutorials on
game physics, some wikipedia [articles][rk4-wikipedia], BTC 7941 keyboard and
loads of [ZUN][ZUN]'s music are very much of help too.
